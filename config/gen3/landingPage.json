The goal of the <strong>MC2DP</strong> is to discover and study advanced precision technologies that will enable prevention, early detection, and enhanced treatments of cancers potentially arising due to exposures to environmental contaminants and toxin hazards by military service members and veterans. <br/> The vision of <strong>MC2DP</strong> is to integrate federal scientific platforms with public-private innovators revealing the impact of service-related exposures to environmental contaminants and toxin hazards and developing prevention and early detection approaches and advanced treatments of cancers arising from these exposures."
